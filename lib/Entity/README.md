Entity Space

So this service is generally accessible...?

Or players interact with the sentience layer which interacts with
the entity space... so entity space is always really auth-free?

(other than for testing?)

How do I then prevent non-services from using the service?  if not from 
authentication and having certain badges.

can I even assign badges or sashes yet
